# The Hunted Hider - First-Person Shooter Game
Welcome to project **The Hunted Hider**, my first-person shooter prototype game in a world overrun by zombies!

## About
This game was my second project during the first year of my Software Development study at SintLucas Eindhoven.
I wanted to create a game where you're in the middle of a zombie apocalypse, defending yourself and searching for a cure.

## What You'll Find
- **Gameplay Elements:** You'll control your character's movement, shoot zombies, and face different challenges.
- **Storyline:** Dive into a world where a failed experiment unleashed a virus which converted everyone into zombies. You're protecting your village house, fighting to survive and keeping yourself safe.
- **Assignment Requirements:** I fulfilled specific criteria like creating a 3D game in Unity, adding player movement and shooting mechanics, designing different game modes and building a map with obstacles.

## How to Play
- **Controls:** Use WASD to move, Shift to sprint, and Space to jump.
- **Weapons:** You start with three weapons: a shotgun for close encounters, a sniper rifle for dealing with enemies from afar, and a pistol for everything in between.
  Switch between them with keys 1 through 3 and shoot with the left mouse button.
- **Health:** Keep an eye on your health bar at the bottom left of the screen. If it is empty, you're dead!
- **Enemies:** Watch out for different zombie types. Regular ones attack up close, while poison zombies throw poison at you from afar.

## Levels
- **Level 1:** Wipe out all zombies to move win.
- **Level 2:** Survive against waves of zombies appearing randomly.
